('description_x'). The list of columns in `df_matches` clearly shows 'description' and 'description_x'. 'description' is for job postings, and 'description_x' is for the company data (as it was merged from `df_companies` and the original column name was 'description'). The issue must be with the actual data in the 'description_x' column being problematic for the embedding function or the API key still not being configured correctly in the environment. Since I cannot directly configure the environment, I will proceed assuming the API key issue is external and will focus on the KeyError. The traceback consistently points to 'description_x', even though it appears in the column list. This is puzzling. However, since the primary focus for text similarity is between resume text and job descriptions, I will prioritize getting those embeddings and similarity scores calculated and then attempt the company description embeddings again, or skip it if it continues to cause issues as it's marked as optional. I will keep the existing code structure but will specifically confirm the column names again before attempting embedding generation.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000},"id":"9SQy3wEIHe7u","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1752197624326,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":353,"user":{"displayName":"夏村学","userId":"12419211746980296102"}},"outputId":"260af0a9-c938-4a2f-8493-ca8b3e0e437d"},"source":["import google.generativeai as genai\n","from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity\n","import os\n","import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","\n","# Configure the Google Generative AI API key\n","# Ensure you have set the GOOGLE_API_KEY environment variable\n","# Replace with your actual API key if not using environment variable\n","# genai.configure(api_key=\"YOUR_API_KEY\")\n","genai.configure(api_key=os.environ.get(\"GOOGLE_API_KEY\"))\n","\n","# Define the embedding model\n","embedding_model = \"models/embedding-001\"\n","\n","# Function to generate embeddings for a list of texts\n","def generate_embeddings(texts):\n","    embeddings = []\n","    for text in texts:\n","        if pd.isna(text):\n","            # Handle missing text by appending a vector of zeros or skipping\n","            embeddings.append(np.zeros(768)) # Assuming embedding dimension is 768 for this model\n","        else:\n","            # Ensure text is a string\n","            text = str(text)\n","            try:\n","                # Generate embedding using the API\n","                result = genai.embed_content(\n","                    model=embedding_model,\n","                    content=text,\n","                    task_type=\"SEMANTIC_SIMILARITY\" # Specify task type\n","                )\n","                embeddings.append(result['embedding'])\n","            except Exception as e:\n","                print(f\"Error generating embedding for text: {text[:50]}...

However, I have successfully implemented step 1 (creating pairs) and step 2 (calculating structured scores). I have also prepared the DataFrame with columns for embeddings and similarity scores.

environment was successfully set up with Flask, MySQL connector, and Google Generative AI libraries.\n","*   A comprehensive MySQL database schema was designed for job seekers, companies, job postings, and matches, including tables for skills and linking tables.\n","*   Sample data for job seekers, companies, and job postings were created and loaded into pandas DataFrames, with basic preprocessing like numerical conversion and simple feature extraction performed.\n","*   An initial structured matching score was calculated based on structured data points like salary, experience, location, and job title.\n","*   Attempts to generate text embeddings and calculate text similarity using the Google Generative AI API failed due to a missing API key, resulting in zero text similarity scores.\n","*   The combined matching score was calculated, but effectively only reflected the structured score due to the lack of meaningful text similarity scores.\n","*   A hierarchical matching concept was partially implemented by filtering matches based on a minimum structured score and then sorting by the combined score.\n","*   Top matching job postings per job seeker were successfully identified based on the filtered and sorted combined scores.\n","*   Implementation of XAI explanations using Gemini failed due to the missing API key, resulting in placeholder explanations.\n","*   A Flask application was developed with routes to display job seekers, job postings, individual details, and matching results, including placeholders for database interaction and XAI display.\n","*   A Flask endpoint (`/feedback`) was implemented to receive and save feedback into the database.\n","*   Theoretical discussions were provided on how to use feedback and employee knowledge for continuous model improvement and enhancing XAI explanations.\n","*   Functional testing of the Flask application endpoints could not be performed due to the application not running in the execution environment.\n","*   Qualitative evaluation of matching accuracy was limited to the structured scores due to the failed text similarity calculation.\n","*   Qualitative evaluation of XAI explanations was not possible as explanations were not generated due to the API key issue.\n","*   Key considerations, potential bottlenecks, and improvement directions for performance testing in a production environment were discussed.\n","\n","### Insights or Next Steps\n","\n","*   Resolving the Google API key configuration is critical to enable the multimodal learning (text embedding and similarity) and XAI explanation generation functionalities, which are core components of the desired system.\n","*   Developing a robust testing framework is essential for validating the Flask application's functionality, the matching algorithm's accuracy (requiring a ground truth dataset), and the quality of XAI explanations once the API issues are resolved.\n"]}]}
